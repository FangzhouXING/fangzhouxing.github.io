For the past several months I didn't have time to work on this. But now I am back.

One of the difficulties I had when I worked on the project was the fact that JS doesn't distinguish between Integer and float number. And it is dynamically typed. I don't particularly like JS, so these extra problems drove me crazy.

In the past few days, I found that WebAssembly works reasonably well with golang, so I decided to use golang + WebAssembly to do the remaining work. That means rewrite most of the code, but it should be fairly simple.

Hopefully, I can finish accomplish my goal much faster.
